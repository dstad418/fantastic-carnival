This is my project to develop my own website.

The project itself uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JS.
Originally was going to use media queries to determine responsiveness, but instead opted for CSS Grid and Flexbox 
to determine that. I used a variety of resources to not only remember simple stuff that I had forgotten, and wanted 
to reeducate myself on, but also to get the concepts of what functionality was needed to tackle the carousel. The
Contact Me button was a requirement, but doesn't have any backend functionality, and is solely to meet the 
requirement of the project. 


Frameworks:
CSS Grid
CSS Flex
CSS Bootstrap


Below are some of the blog posts that I used. There were more than this, but these are the handful that I had openned 
more than once to solve something that wasn't a quick-fix.
